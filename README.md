# Piggy Pad Firmware Workspace
Collection of firmware for Piggy Pad Cables (cables that grab data from a retro controller and pass it thruto USB via an expansion port on Bit Bang Gaming control boards).

More infomration and documentation to come. But in summary, this code uses a UART module to poll for data from a N64 controller. The idea was suggested by fellow programmers and it turns out someone did this a bit ago: http://www.qwertymodo.com/hardware-projects/n64/n64-controller

I had to fill some of the details in but it after a few days of wrestling with it, it does work very reliably.

These docs also helped with the N64 controller protocol.
